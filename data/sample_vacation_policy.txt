VACATION POLICY - COMPLETE GUIDE

1. ANNUAL LEAVE ENTITLEMENT

Full-time employees (100%):
- 25 days of paid vacation per year
- Accrues from first day of employment

Part-time employees:
- Vacation days pro-rated based on working hours
- 80% employment = 20 days per year (25 × 0.8)
- 60% employment = 15 days per year (25 × 0.6)
- 50% employment = 12.5 days per year (25 × 0.5)

Examples:
- Employee working 80% receives: 25 × 0.8 = 20 vacation days per year
- Employee working 75% receives: 25 × 0.75 = 18.75 vacation days per year


2. VACATION ACCRUAL

Monthly accrual rate:
- Full-time: 2.08 days per month (25 ÷ 12)
- Part-time: 2.08 × employment percentage per month

Accrual starts:
- From first day of employment
- Available for use after 3 months probation period

Calculation examples:
- Full-time employee after 6 months: 6 × 2.08 = 12.48 days
- 80% employee after 6 months: 6 × 2.08 × 0.8 = 9.98 days
- Full-time employee after 12 months: 12 × 2.08 = 24.96 ≈ 25 days

Mid-year start date calculation:
- Employee starting March 15, 2024 (full-time):
  - March 15 - December 31 = 9.5 months
  - Accrual: 9.5 × 2.08 = 19.76 days for 2024
- Employee starting March 15, 2024 (80%):
  - Accrual: 9.5 × 2.08 × 0.8 = 15.81 days for 2024


3. PROBATION PERIOD

6. VACATION CALCULATION FOR YEAR TRANSITION

Example scenario:
Employee started March 15, 2024, working 80%, used 3 days in 2024.

2024 calculation:
- Employment period: March 15 - December 31 (9.5 months)
- Accrual: 9.5 × 2.08 × 0.8 = 15.81 days
- Used: 3 days
- Remaining: 15.81 - 3 = 12.81 days
- Can carry over: 5 days (maximum)
- Lost: 7.81 days

2025 calculation (if planning vacation in July):
- January 1 - June 30: 6 × 2.08 × 0.8 = 9.98 days
- Carried over from 2024: 5 days
- Total available by July 1, 2025: 9.98 + 5 = 14.98 days

Note: If employee wants to take 18 days in July 2025:
- Has 14.98 days available by July 1
- Needs special approval for 3+ extra days (exceeds 15-day limit)
- Could wait until end of July to accrue more days
- By July 31: Additional 1 month = 2.08 × 0.8 = 1.66 days
- Total by July 31: 14.98 + 1.66 = 16.64 days (still need approval for 18)


7. VACATION PAYOUT

General policy:

Upon termination:
